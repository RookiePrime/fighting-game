### Frequently Asked Questions
#### What technologies did you use to create this game?
This game runs almost entirely on core ES6 libraries. The animation of the healthbars, however, is the result of the package gsap. Thanks, gsap!
#### Did you come up with this yourself?
Nope! I followed a tutorial on YouTube, which you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ. I made my own adjustments, however, such as utilizing a CSS stylesheet, modifying the damage output of the fighters, and preventing the player from jumping while airborne.
